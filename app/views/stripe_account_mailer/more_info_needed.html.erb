<p>Dear <%= @nonprofit.name %>,</p>

<p>It looks like you submitted your updated verification form, but Stripe has requested more information. This is a normal part of Stripe’s verification process and often occurs because of entry errors, name changes, or discrepancies in records. In other cases, Stripe may simply need additional information. You can submit more information for verification by following this link: <%= link_to(confirm_nonprofits_stripe_account_url(@nonprofit), confirm_nonprofits_stripe_account_url(@nonprofit))%></p>

<p>Completed verification for your account is required for you to continue to use CommitChange’s Donate Button, campaign, and event features. <% if @deadline -%>
The deadline for finishing the verification process for your CommitChange account is <strong><%=  @deadline %></strong>. <% else -%>
You are advised to complete this verification as soon as possible.<% end -%></p>

<p>We appreciate the honor of serving all of our nonprofit and social venture organizations; if you have any questions about the new process or need help completing your form before the deadline, please reach out to the support team at <a href="mailto:<%= Settings.devise.mailer_sender %>"><%= Settings.devise.mailer_sender %></a>.</p>
